In the **"Balancing Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Datasets with CNN"** project, I used **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to address the challenge of imbalanced datasets, a key concern for stakeholders seeking accurate AI solutions for **image recognition** and **object tracking**. By applying **data augmentation** and **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**, I generated additional data for underrepresented categories, improving the model's performance and ensuring it could accurately classify both common and rare items. I also implemented techniques like **dropout** and **early stopping** to prevent overfitting, while integrating the CNN with **OpenCV** for real-time object tracking, delivering a scalable, reliable solution that meets business needs for practical and high-performing AI applications.

●	Tackled CNN overfitting in imbalanced datasets and completed practical projects in image recognition and object tracking.
●	Balanced datasets and trained CNNs completing projects in image recognition and object tracking using CNNs, OpenCV, and advanced techniques like GANs.
