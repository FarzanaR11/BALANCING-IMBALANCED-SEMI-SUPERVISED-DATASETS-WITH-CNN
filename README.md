In the "Balancing Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Datasets with CNN" project from my previous company, I used TensorFlow Pytorch, and Keras to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition, directly addressing a key concern for stakeholders seeking accurate AI-driven solutions for image classification tasks. The dataset, containing cats and dogs images from CIFAR-10, had a slight imbalance, with 5000 cat images and 6000 dog images. To address the imbalance and prevent overfitting, I employed data augmentation techniques (such as rotating, flipping, and zooming images) for both classes, which helped increase the diversity of the data and improve the model's generalization. 

Additionally, I applied techniques like dropout and early stopping during training to prevent the model from overfitting to the majority class and ensure that it could generalize well across both classes. This approach aligned with the company's goals of delivering a scalable and reliable AI solution that can handle real-world challenges in image recognition and object tracking tasks, ensuring the model meets both performance and accuracy requirements for the business. This solution was specifically designed to help the company build more effective image classification and object tracking systems, ensuring that the AI can perform well even with imbalanced data, which is critical for real-world applications.
